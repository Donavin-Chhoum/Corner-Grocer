# Corner-Grocer
A project that I had for a CS-210 course.

The goal of this project was to create a program that reads a files that contains data of products sold. The file should only have the name of the item sold and the name of the item could appear multiple times. The program reads the file and counts how many times each product was sold. The problem that this program solves is providing the end user with data on their sales. It shows them which items are popular and which ones aren't. The program also saves the data after calculating it to a new file called "frequency.dat"

For this project, I believe that I did well in decluttering the main() function. Most of my code are within the CornerUtility.cpp file and I have comments for each function so I know what each function does at a glance.

One way I could enchance the code is to make it so that the user provides the file to the program rather than having the put the file needed into the folder with the program. This would make it more efficient for the user to search multiple different days of sales. This would also make it more secure as the user has the provide the data rather than the program just reading the data of whatever file is within the program's folder.

The code that I found to be the most challenging was using the map object. I had knowledge of arrays and vectors going into this course but I had never used the map object and it was an optional thing to learn within the course which also meant that learning page for it was pretty short. I overcame this issue by simply looking up information on maps any time I had an issue or question.

The skill that I can transfer to other projects and course work that I used in this project is that creating a function is much more preferable than writing duplicate code. If it is used more than once, it should probably be its own function.

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding plenty of comments explaining what certain lines of code does and what each function does. Each function's name also clearly states what they do. The code is also organized so it shouldn't be too hard to understand.
